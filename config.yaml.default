  #
  #            check_interval: The number of seconds to wait before updating the view.

progress:
  # phase_line_end: These are the settings that will be used to dictate when a phase ends in the progress bar. It is
  #                 supposed to reflect the line at which the phase will end so the progress calculations can use that
  #                 information with the existing log file to calculate a progress percent.
  #   phase_weight: These are the weight to assign to each phase in the progress calculations. Typically, Phase 1 and 3
  #                 are the longest phases so they will hold more weight than the others.
  phase1_line_end: 801

global:
  # These are the settings that will be used globally by the plot manager.
  #
  # max_concurrent: The maximum number of plots that your system can run. The manager will not kick off more than this
  #                 number of plots total over time.
  max_concurrent: 10


jobs:
  # These are the settings that will be used by each job. Please note you can have multiple jobs and each job should be
  # in YAML format in order for it to be interpreted correctly. Almost all the values here will be passed into the
  # Chia executable file.
  #
  # Check for more details on the Chia CLI here: https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/wiki/CLI-Commands-Reference
  #
  # name: This is the name that you want to give to the job.
  # max_plots: This is the maximum number of jobs to make in one run of the manager. Any restarts to manager will reset
  #            this variable. It is only here to help with short term plotting.
  #
  # [OPTIONAL] farmer_public_key: Your farmer public key. If none is provided, it will not pass in this variable to the
  #                               chia executable which results in your default keys being used. This is only needed if
  #                               you have chia set up on a machine that does not have your credentials.
  # [OPTIONAL] pool_public_key: Your pool public key. Same information as the above.
  #
  # temporary_directory: Only a single directory should be passed into here. This is where the plotting will take place.
  # [OPTIONAL] temporary2_directory: Can be a single value or a list of values. This is an optional parameter to use in
  #                                  case you want to use the temporary2 directory functionality of Chia plotting.
  # destination_directory: Can be a single value or a list of values. This is the final directory where the plot will be
  #                        transferred once it is completed. If you provide a list, it will cycle through each drive
  #                        one by one.
  #
  # size: This refers to the k size of the plot. You would type in something like 32, 33, 34, 35... in here.
  # bitfield: This refers to whether you want to use bitfield or not in your plotting. Typically, you want to keep
  #           this as true.
  # threads: This is the number of threads that will be assigned to the plotter. Only phase 1 uses more than 1 thread.
  # buckets: The number of buckets to use. The default provided by Chia is 128.
  # memory_buffer: The amount of memory you want to allocate to the process.
  # max_concurrent: The maximum number of plots to have for this job at any given time.
  # max_concurrent_with_start_early: The maximum number of plots to have for this job at any given time including
  #                                  phases that started early.
  # stagger_minutes: The amount of minutes to wait before the next job can get kicked off. You can even set this to
  #                  zero if you want your plots to get kicked off immediately when the concurrent limits allow for it.
  # max_for_phase_1: The maximum number of plots on phase 1 for this job.
  # concurrency_start_early_phase: The phase in which you want to start a plot early. It is recommended to use 4 for
  #                                this field.
  # concurrency_start_early_phase_delay: The maximum number of seconds to wait before a new plot gets kicked off when
  #                                      the start early phase has been detected.
  # temporary2_destination_sync: This field will always submit the destination directory as the temporary2 directory.
  #                              These two directories will be in sync so that they will always be submitted as the
  #                              same value.
